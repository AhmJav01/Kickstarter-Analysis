# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing an analysis via Microsoft Excel on data titled "Kickstarter" to uncover data trends
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to learn how to use Microsoft Excel I order to calculate trends for a certain data set, while also learning how to create charts and pivot tables from the same data set.  For this exercise, we used data collected by Louise regarding the goal, amount pledged, outcome, date launched, and other data points.
## Analysis and Challenges
* The analysis of the exercise resulted in two charts created; One chart was entitled “Outcomes Based on Goals” and the other “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”. The chart “Outcomes Based on Goals” was a line graph that compared the percent of successful, failed, and canceled kick starters for plays based on the goal amount ranging from $1000 to above $50000. The chart “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” was in reference to data regarding that “theater” subcategory, and looked at the number of successful, failed, and canceled kick starters based on their launch dates.
* When creating the spreadsheets, the instructions were straight forward to the point that there were little to no challenges when creating tables and/or charts. Any errors that came up during the exercise were due to human error, i.e., typing in the wrong letter, or forgetting to close a parenthesis. 
## Results
Three conclusions that can be made about the data from the charts created are that:
1.	May has the most successful Kickstarter launches for the subcategory of theater at approximately 67% (As shown in image 1)
2.	Theater Kickstarts that were launched in December had almost as many failed kickstarts (35) as successful kickstarts (37) (As shown in image 1)
3.	Plays that had a goal of less than $1000 were the most successful at 76% success rate (As shown in Image 2)

Some limitations for this exercise were that kick starters that were live during the period where data was being collected, could not be used in the results as their results were inconclusive. While one of the graphs was created based on Kick starter launch dates, another graph could be created based on the deadline for the kick starters. You could also take this a step further and investigate the failed kick starters while comparing the percentage of the goal reached vs how much time was given to reach the goal.
